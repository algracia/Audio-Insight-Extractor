hi my name is alberto gracia i am physics engineer and software developer in this short demo i will show you python app that i created to transcribe strategic meetings audios and extract information of them the main goal of this app is to make easier the process of doing the documentation and the summaries of meeting in company or in our organization because for example during my time as the cto of company i had to go to lot of meetings and in each meeting i had to write and take notes of the relevant or the key points of the conversation but by doing this i wasnt able to focus completely on the conversation and there was another issue because after those meetings i had to write everything again from my notebook to my computer to have it all in my cloud and for it was such waste of time but after i created this app i only had to record all the audio of the meeting by using my cell phone for example because the app uses openeyes whisper model to transcribe the recorded audio into clean and readable text then this text is processed and i can use the chat gpd api to extract the most relevant points or do another analysis for example suggesting innovative solutions identifying potential needs and other things
